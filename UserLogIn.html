                        <p>1.			INTRODUCTION <br>

 

                            1.1.	Welcome to the SNEAKE platform (the "Site"). Please read the following Terms of Service carefully before using this Site or opening a SNEAKE account ("Account") so that you are aware of your legal rights and obligations with respect to SNEAKE Philippines Inc. and its affiliates and subsidiaries (individually and collectively, "SNEAKE", "we", "us" or "our"). The "Services" we provide or make available include (a) the Site, (b) the services provided by the Site and by SNEAKE client software made available through the Site, and (c) all information, linked pages, features, data, text, images, photographs, graphics, music, sounds, video (including live streams), messages, tags, content, programming, software, application services (including, without limitation, any mobile application services) or other materials made available through the Site or its related services ("Content"). Any new features added to or augmenting the Services are also subject to these Terms of Service. These Terms of Service govern your use of Services provided by SNEAKE. <br> <br>
                            
                             
                            
                            1.2	The Services include an online platform service that provides a place and opportunity for the sale of goods between the buyer (“Buyer”) and the seller (“Seller”) (collectively “you”, “Users” or “Parties”). The actual contract for sale is directly between Buyer and Seller and SNEAKE is not a party to that or any other contract between Buyer and Seller and accepts no obligations in connection with any such contract. Parties to such transaction will be entirely responsible for the sales contract between them, the listing of goods, warranty of purchase and the like. SNEAKE is not involved in the transaction between Users. SNEAKE may or may not pre-screen Users or the Content or information provided by Users. SNEAKE reserves the right to remove any Content or information posted by you on the Site in accordance to Section 6.4 herein. SNEAKE cannot ensure that Users will actually complete a transaction.
